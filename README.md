# JAVA-CustomProperties
my custom lib to deal with properties files in java
 * Class to treat property files as a List, the main focus is to deal with property files with order and write in UTF-8 Encoding
 
 *  Also handle multi Thread read/write at same time on same file with a synchronized queue system
 
 *  Also have a little versioning system
 
 *  Please save after all modifications, and refresh() to reload from file if you keep working on the same file
 
 It requires a propertie file and a reference propertie file to find difference between 2 files, can not work without a reference proeprtie file
